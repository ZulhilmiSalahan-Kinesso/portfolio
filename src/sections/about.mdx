## About Me

Just an average guy who like to develop and learn new things and always find way to make work easy. I have 5 years of working experience in Software Testing mostly in automation. I automate desktop, web, mobile and cloud application. The technology I use to automate are using HP UFT, Selenium and Appium in python, Robot framework, Specflow in C# and PowerShell for Azure Cloud Deployment. I have work with various project too which are Application Performance, Custom Mobile Application, Booking website and Azure Cloud Billing. During free time I do development for web and mobile application and learn the latest technology such as angular and ionic framework and keep my skills up to date.
